## [2025-06-30] The Great EMH Confusion: Why Critics and Defenders Keep Missing Each Other

The decades-long Efficient Market Hypothesis debate persists because participants argue about two different questions without realizing it. Critics point to market inefficiencies to "disprove" EMH, while defenders cite logical consistency. Both miss the point.
EMH is a conditional theory: "IF certain conditions exist, THEN markets are efficient." You can't invalidate it by showing inefficiency when those conditions don't exist—that's basic logic. But this raises a different question: if the theory requires impossible conditions, what practical value does it offer?

The real debate should distinguish between "Is the theory logically correct?" and "Should it guide real-world decisions?" Understanding this difference could finally move us beyond the unproductive "right vs. wrong" arguments.

## [2025-06-30] The Phillips Curve Evolution: From Flattening to Steepening and the Search for Normalization

The Phillips Curve underwent a dramatic transformation: from seeming death in the 2010s to resurrection during COVID-19. During the "Great Flattening" (2008-2019), unemployment fell to historic lows while inflation stayed flat, leading many to declare the relationship "dead." Fed Chair Powell called it a "faint heartbeat."

COVID-19 reversed this pattern. Phillips Curves steepened 170-270% across 29 countries as inflation surged despite stable unemployment. Three explanations compete: unanchored expectations, doubled price-change frequency (10% to 20% monthly), and sectoral supply constraints making goods prices highly demand-sensitive.

Advanced econometric methods reveal the flattening was partly illusory—successful monetary policy made the relationship empirically invisible, not structurally absent. Traditional approaches underestimated slopes and exaggerated the decline.

Current evidence shows partial normalization but varies by country. Australia shows no steepening when properly identified, while the U.S. maintains elevated price flexibility. The key question: was steepening temporary pandemic response or permanent structural change?

The implications matter: steeper curves suggest easier disinflation, but uncertainty demands robust policy frameworks while maintaining the credibility that stabilized expectations.
